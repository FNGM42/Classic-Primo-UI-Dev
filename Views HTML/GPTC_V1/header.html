<!--NB: When translating a static html page that includes images, the link of the image must be replaced as follows:
The existing link: "../images/imageName.gif" must be changed into: "../locale/specifcLocaleCode/images/imageName.gif" where "specifcLocaleCode" represents the relevant locale of the language (e.g en_US for English USA, zh_CH for Chinese).
